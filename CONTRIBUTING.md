=====

Contributions are totally welcome!
Changes should be submitted as Pull Requests on Github.
I will do my best to respond quickly, but feel free to comment on the PR if it's taking a long time.

Bugfixes should include a new test case.
Changes to existing tests will be considered a red flag, though not excluded outright.

Coding standards are noted in the `.editorconfig` file located at the project root.
Changes must adhere to that formatting.
Test fixtures are excluded from coding standards, since they can include forattming tests for various source material.
