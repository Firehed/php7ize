php7ize
=====
php7ize is a command-line utility for quickly adding PHP7 features to a PHP5 codebase.

Installation
-----
The only officially-supported method of installation is via Composer and Packagist.
Because this is not intended to be treated as a project dependency, it's recommended to be installed globally:

    composer global require firehed/php7ize

If you have not already done so, add Composer's global `bin` directory to your `PATH`:

    # ~/.bash_profile
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin

Usage
-----
(more details coming soon)


Updating
-----
Use Composer's global update mechanism:

    composer global update
